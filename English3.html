            computers,
            to be in different places in every way
            light, carry out the calculation and in this way generate new blocks of the blockchain. Tsyu system

            be like
            cryptocurrencies.
            The work of the miners is based on the fact that they choose one-single hash from millions of combinations
            (the result
            mathematical
            transformation to the block) in front of the front block - this way you can “attach” one more block. Over

        <p class="content__text-big">The organizers of the fraudulent scheme often choose little-known cryptocurrencies
          (but this

          to do with the famous, it's just that scammers need more money for this. – Ed.) and start buying little by
          little,
          in order to
          this
          the process did not affect the market price.
          The second stage is the Pump itself. Fraudsters begin to distribute "exclusive" information about
          what
          this one
          the coin is about to increase in value.
          This is done through a huge number of "expert" Telegram channels, groups in social networks or bloggers.
          The main thing is
          create the illusion of asset growth.
          So that the statements are not empty, fraudsters also begin to buy cryptocurrency so that it starts to grow in
          prices
          If the number of those who believed the information and want to get rich instantly is sufficient, the
          cryptocurrency is
          real
          starts
          become more expensive, because many victims of fraudsters begin to buy it, thereby pushing the price up.
          But here comes the Dump stage. Fraudsters instantly sell all their coins and the price goes down. More often
          even lower,
          than
          was before
          pump.
          Often the victims of this scheme know that they are participating in a Pump&Dump, but hope that they will have
          time to
          sell theirs
          coins
          in time,
          after all, the fraudsters promised to warn about the date of the "downpour". But fraudsters are also
          fraudsters to
          deceive.
          Interestingly, Pump&Dump can only take hours or a few minutes if the cryptocurrency is relatively cheap. But
          happened
          cases of long-term "pumping" of top coins.
