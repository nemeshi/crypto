                    <p class="section__text">A number is a sign for writing a number.<br> There are many numbers - Arabic, Roman,<br> Hexadecimal, etc. A number is one of the main <br>objects of mathematics, which is used <br>for counting, measuring and labeling.<br> A number consists of digits. A digit<br> can be a number, but a number<br> is not a digit. The number is only 10 (1, 2, 3,<br> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0). These numbers can<br> be numbers. But for example<br> some two-digit, three-digit<br> number cannot be a digit.<br> Number 12 - consists of the digits 1 and 2. </p>

                    <p class="section__text">Pythagoras claimed that the world<br> consists of numbers: each thing<br> has its own number, and there can even be<br> more than one, because the elements of things<br> also have their own numbers.<br> Now we know that a number<br> consists of numbers, that's how the first<br> depends on the other.</p>

                <h2 class="section__title">Mining and the mining boom.</h2>
                <p class="section__text">Mining is the activity of maintaining a distributed<br> platform and creating new blocks with the ability to<br> receive a reward in the form of issued currency in<br> various cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins. <br>The essence of mining is to select such a value<br> Nonce(A random number used during<br> cryptographic communication only once. Nonce is often<br> a random or pseudo-random number generated<br> by the authentication protocol), which will allow get a<br> hash containing a specified number of zeros at the <br>beginning of this hash. The number of <br>zeros in the hash is chosen in such a way that each<br> block appears approximately<br> once every 6-10 minutes.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="section__maining-second">
                <p class="section__text">A mining boom is when cryptocurrency starts<br> to rise sharply in price, and because of this,<br> miners start to buy video cards (because cryptocurrency<br> mining takes place thanks to them). And there is a shortage<br> of video cards. The first boom took place in 2017, <br>when Bitcoin rose to $20,000. But it lasted until 18 years ago,<br> when it was halved this year. And already at<br> the beginning of the 21st year, the biggest surge took place. <br>Bitcoin rose in price to 64,000 dollars.</p>
                <p class="section__text-right section__text">And this was followed by a shortage of video cards. <br>Do you want to assemble a PC from the most <br>modern components? Let be happy. The industry has <br>struggled with component shortages for years, <br>but the problem became apparent in 2020<br> when the pandemic delayed supplies as people<br> returned to home offices and began buying<br> the equipment they needed to support their businesses<br > afloat. Nvidia will also produce special<br> Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMPs), which are not<br> as complex as conventional graphics cards.</p>
                <p class="section__text">The graphics card manufacturer follows this strategy to<br> avoid past experiences with the cryptocurrency<br> market cycle. It will be interesting to see how NVIDIA and <br>AMD react. Obviously there is more demand than supply, so<br> it must be very tempting to expand their production lines<br> and sell many more GPUs at<br> inflated prices prices - they will not want to miss this<br> opportunity to make a huge profit. But there is a<br> real risk that Ethereum could suddenly<br> collapse and mining it is no longer worth the cost of<br> electricity.</p>
                <p class="section__text-right section__text">Then NVIDIA/AMD will be stuck with a load of unsold<br> GPUs, plus a load of useless manufacturing<br> capacity, plus a load of useless components; and<br> Internet stores will be filled with cheap<br> used graphics processors from miners, which<br> will fully satisfy the remaining demand from<br> gamers; and current generation GPUs will<br> be obsolete in a year or two when the next<br> generation comes out.<br> As happened at the end of 2022.</p>
